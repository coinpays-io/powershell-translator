# Welcome to PowerShell Translator From CoinPays!

A script running on Windows PowerShell that helps find language translations used in all files.

- **Translation Extraction**: Identifies and extracts language translation strings.
- **Flexible File Handling**: Works with various file types commonly used in software development.
